Hello any college admissions committee members that came here to look at my code!

To specifiy a few things in case my application didn't say it. 

1. The ful stack I used is React and Tailwind front end with a Socket.io powered backend. 
2. The client was ran on Github Pages, because it's free, while the server was ran on Render, because it was also free.
3. I used a MongoDB database to store player data, so if you were to run this game you would need to also set up a new MongoDB database. You could use a different database, but you would then have to refactor how the server handles data
4. Because of these facts the application propably won't be able to run without extensive set up, and so I included a few screenshots of me and my friends playing.

Other things to note is that this project began May 2025 (forgot the exact date) but this github page only documents the most recent version. I made a different (Half finished) version on my other github repository. This version is a Discord Bot that was made to be a DnD add-on, however I got frustrated with it's limitations and so decided to make my very own thing instead. 

For any committe members that wish to actually try and play the game here is a step by step proccess on how to do it.

1. Make a fork of this repo on your own account. 
2. Set up github pages for the client folder
3. Make a render account (or another server hosting site)
4. Set up
