Hello there travler!

This is an ongoing DnD based mangment system for all your needs. This includes a inventory managment system, map making, combat system, and everything inbetwen.

This, however, is not, **I REPEAT** it is **NOT** actual DnD. It's a system based off of DnD that has it's own systems and scaling. This is currently not functional but once it is you can use it here:

Once again thank you for viewing this, and welcome to the world of Dungeons not Mastered.
